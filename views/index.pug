    p User Stories
        ul
            li I can pass a string as a parameter, and it will check to see whether that string contains either a unix timestamp or a natural language date (example: January 1, 2016)
            li If it does, it returns both the Unix timestamp and the natural language form of that date.
            li If it does not contain a date or Unix timestamp, it returns null for those properties.
            
    h2 Example Usage:
        p 
            ul
                li 
                    pre #{baseurl}/1607990400
                li 
                    pre #{baseurl}/December%2015,%202020
    h2 Example output:
        pre {"unix":"1607990400","natural":"Tue, 15 Dec 2020 00:00:00 GMT"}
